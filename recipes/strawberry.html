    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Shortcake</h4>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup cold buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced strawberries</li>
        <h4>Strawberry Topping</h4>
        <li>4 cups ripe strawberries, hulled and quartered</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, zested</li>
        <h4>Whipped Cream</h4>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch cast iron skillet; line the bottom with a round of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt for shortcake together in a large mixing bowl. Whisk buttermilk, egg yolk, and vanilla together in a glass measuring cup until evenly combined; set aside.</li>
        <li>Scatter the butter pieces over the flour mixture. Use a rubbing motion with your fingertips and cut the butter into the flour mixture to distribute. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the center of the well. Use a rubber spatula to mix the flour into the buttermilk mixture to form a moist, shaggy dough.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the prepared skillet. Smooth the dough to distribute evenly in the pan. Press the sliced strawberries gently into the surface.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and baked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>To prepare the topping, stir together the quartered strawberries, sugar, and lemon zest in a medium mixing bowl to macerate.</li>
        <li>To prepare the whipped cream, combine whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla in a chilled mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat at medium speed until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Spoon the strawberries and juices over the shortcake. Serve with whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
